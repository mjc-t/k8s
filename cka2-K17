# 17. TLS

There is an existing deployment called **nginx-static** in the **nginx-static** namespace.

The deployment contains a **ConfigMap** that supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3, and a **Secret** for TLS.

There is a service called nginx-static in the nginx-static namespace that is currently exposing the deployment.

Tasks:

1. Configure the **configmap** to only support **TLSv1.3**.
2. Add the IP address of the service in **/etc/hosts** and name **ITKiddie.k8s.local**.
3. Verify that everything is working using the following command:
    
    curl --tls-max 1.2 https://ITKIddie.k8s.local -k (TLSv1.2 shoud not work)
    
    curl --tlsv1.3 https://ITKiddie.k8s.local -k
