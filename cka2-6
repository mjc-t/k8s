# Q6. ArgoCD Install

- Install ArgoCD in the cluster by performing the following tasks: Add the official **Argo CD Helm repository** with the name **argo**.
- Generate a **template of the ArgoCD Helm Chart version 7.7.3** for the **argocd** namespace and save it to **~/argo-helm.yaml**. Configure the chart to **not install CRDS**
- Note - The Argo CD CRDs have already been pre-installed in the cluster.
