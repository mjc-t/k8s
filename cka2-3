Q3. Sidecar
Update the existing deployment synergy-leverager, adding a co-located container named sidecar using the busybox:stable image to the existing pod.
The new co-located container has to run the following command: /bin sh -c “tail -n+1 -f /var/log/synergy-everger.log”. Use a volume mounted at /var/log to make the log file synergy-leverager.log available to the co-located container.
